The standalone python program main_sitePercolation.py contains function
defintions for a union find based algorithm for site percolation.  Albeit the
implementation is slightly different, it is based on the idea of the fast
percolation algorithm detailed in

"Fast Monte Carlo algorithm for site and bond percolation"
Newman, M.E.J. and Ziff, R.M.
PRE 64 (2001) 016706

Exemplary usage:

python main_sitePercolation.py chimera_N32768.dimacs.gz 1

Therein, the bonfile needs to follow the dimacs edge-list format.
